# Arabic Company Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in Arabic reviews about companies and their apps. Students will develop a sentiment analysis model using classical machine learning approaches to classify Arabic text reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding Arabic text preprocessing challenges
- Implementing NLP techniques for Arabic language
- Building and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment analysis
- Handling real-world Arabic text data


## Recommended Libraries
### Essential Libraries
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computing
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms

### Arabic NLP Specific
- CAMeL Tools: Comprehensive Arabic morphological analysis
- tashaphyne: Arabic light stemmer

### Text Processing & Visualization
- re: Regular expressions for text cleaning
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- wordcloud: Word cloud visualization

## Suggested Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing 
   - Text cleaning (remove special characters, numbers) (Justify)
   - Stop words removal (Justify)
   - Convert text to vectors (TF-IDF, Bag-of-words, ...) (Which better?)

2. Model Development 
   - Try different classical ML algorithms:
   - Parameter tuning (If needed)

3. Evaluation & Analysis 


## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-Score
- Precision and Recall
- Confusion Matrix
